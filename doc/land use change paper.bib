    abstract = {Land-use/land-cover (LULC) change models integrate the effects of anthropogenic drivers of landscape change. Spatially explicit LULC change models help at understanding the landscape mosaic that emerges from the interplay between local-scale decisions as well as regional and national policies. These models produce valuable spatially explicit scenarios of LULC change that underpin biodiversity impact and ecosystem services assessments. Most raster-based LULC change models adopt the demand-allocation approach to simulate land transitions (i.e. the transformation of one land-cover type to another for a given spatial unit). In a demand-allocation framework the expert fixes the demand (or quantity of change) and the LULC change model uses a spatial procedure to allocate the change (i.e. to select the cells to be transformed to the target land-cover type). Here, we propose a spatial allocation procedure that builds on the assumption that land transitions occur in two phases: change occurrence and change spreading (or contagion). The allocation procedure uses a sorted queue of cells waiting to undergone change. Three parameters (rate of change occurrence, rate of change spreading and acceleration of change-contagion) control the order of cells order in the queue, and ultimately determine the emergence and extent of patches-of-change. We performed a sensitivity analysis where we show that the relation between both rates (i.e. change occurrence and change spreading) allows patches-of-change expand before other patches arise or vice versa. We provide a simple protocol to implement the allocation procedure as the core of a spatial explicit LULC change model, and we applied this protocol in the development of a new model, called MEDLUC, that intends to replicate the most relevant transitions observed in Mediterranean landscapes: urbanisation, rural abandonment and agriculture conversion. For Catalonia, a region in NE Spain, MEDLUC reproduces the empirical patches-of-change distributions from a 16-year period at two spatial resolutions (1 km2 and 1 ha). Overall, our allocation procedure performs better than a null model for urbanisation and rural abandonment at both resolutions, while it does worse when modelling agriculture conversion.},

    abstract = {This software note announces a new open-source release of the Maxent software for modeling species distributions from occurrence records and environmental data, and describes a new R package for fitting such models. The new release (Version 3.4.0) will be hosted online by the American Museum of Natural History, along with future versions. It contains small functional changes, most notably use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) transform to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog transform derives from the recently-published interpretation of Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package, maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output) as as an estimate of relative abundance. With these two open-source developments, we invite others to freely use and contribute to the software. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},
